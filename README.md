# Early-Detection-of-Parkinson-s-Disease-A-Comparative-Study
This repository contains the code and resources for the mini-project "A Comparative Study: Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease."

In the first semester of my third year, I implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using supervised learning to analyze and compare data for the early detection of Parkinson's disease.

In the second semester, I extended the project by implementing ResNet50 using unsupervised learning to further enhance the detection and analysis process.

The project aims to identify key features and leverage both traditional and deep learning models to aid in the early diagnosis of the disease.
